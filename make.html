      Abacha is a product of cassava tubers. When the processing of it is done
      from scratch, harvested cassava is obtained, peeled, washed, cooked and
      sliced into desired sizes or shapes. It is soaked in a bowl, bucket, etc.,
      for a day. It could prepared instantly as abacha or sun-dried for future
      use. shredded dried cassava first needs to be softened by soaking in
      boiled water and covered up for few minutes.
      <p>
        The decision to add or not to add various condiments/additional
        ingredients is also partly dependent on whether it is intended to be
        consumed as a light, cold snack or more-or-less stand-alone (or at least
        in-between) meal. Abacha can serve both purposes.
